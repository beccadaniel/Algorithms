Case #4: From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.
Case #5: I had often seen him in love before.
Case #6: But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.
Case #7: To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.
Case #8: On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.
Case #9: "FITZWILLIAM DARCY"
Case #10: How he lived I know not.
Case #11: If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.
Case #12: Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best.
Case #13: It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-
Case #14: I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
Case #15: His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question-of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.
Case #16: "I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country.
Case #17: I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.
Case #18: At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
Case #19: Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
Case #20: The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.
Case #21: Your sister I also watched.
Case #22: Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.
Case #23: The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.
Case #24: But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
Case #25: Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.
Case #26: The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
Case #27: But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.
Case #28: "This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.
Case #29: I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.
Case #30: If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error.
Case #31: His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.
Case #32: He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Case #33: The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.
Case #34: His revenge would have been complete indeed.
Case #35: The envelope itself was likewise full.
Case #36: Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"
Case #37: To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.
Case #38: You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.
Case #39: "My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow-and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant.
Case #40: Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.
Case #41: After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.
Case #42: My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.
Case #43: There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.
Case #44: If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.
Case #45: He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.
Case #46: "Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you.
Case #47: If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry.
Case #48: With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.
Case #49: It pains me to offend you.
Case #50: He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.
Case #51: His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances-and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.
Case #52: We accordingly went-and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice.
Case #53: I will only add, God bless you.
Case #54: If it be so, if I have
